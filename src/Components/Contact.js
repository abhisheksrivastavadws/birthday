            My dearest love, 
            <br/>
I want you to know,
<br/>
Your address is in my heart,
<br/>
And it will never let you go.
<br/>
Your beauty is enchanting,
<br/>
Like a precious work of art,
<br/>
And your love is so overwhelming,
<br/>
It has captured my heart.
<br/>

You bring me happiness and joy,
<br/>
With your smile and your laughter,
<br/>
And with you by my side,
<br/>
My world is full of love forever after.
<br/>
So, my love, please know,
<br/>
That you are the one for me,
<br/>
And your address is in my heart,
<br/>
Where you'll always be.
